## Hi there 👋


<!-- **oliveria-dev/oliveria-dev** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my personal projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and discussing emerging technologies! I'm always interested in learning about new tech.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Full Stack Development based projects.
- 💬 Ask me about anything
- 😄 Pronouns: oliveria-dev
- ⚡ Fun fact: Sometimes I fix the production bug by commenting the code!
